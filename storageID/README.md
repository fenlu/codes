Background: The Library Collections Depository (LCD) is an off-site storage facility for old and less-used books and periodicals in UTA library collections. This facility is only accessible to UTA libraries staff, who can retrieve items for users upon request. Normally library items are organized by their call number and staff can retrieve them from shelf based on their call number. However, to save space, the items at LCD are organized based on their size. There is a shelf location ID associated with each item stored at LCD. In Alma, this information is stored as “Internal Note 3” in the item record after migrated from Voyager and cannot be displayed in the call-slip. The stack management team has to manually retrieve this information every time after they print the call-slip.

This application is developed to use Alma API to copy the LCD shelf location information from “Internal Note 3” field to “Storage Location ID” field so the LCD shelf location can be included in the Call-slip.
